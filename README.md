C++ program tracing tool

Uses a constructor to maintain a callstack that can be dumped at any time.

This is a portable approach that does not rely on backtrace() and c++ 
demangling which is very unportable.

The only change you need is to include callstack.h and add "_" at the beginning
of a function (a bit of sedding can do this - reach out to me if you cannot 
do this).

e.g.:
```
        void my_function (void)
        {_
          // rest of code
        }
```

Call CALLSTACK_DUMP() at any time to dump the current callstack.

Just do 

```
make
./callstack 

Stack dump:
(stack) 1 main.cpp void foo3(int, int), line 7
(stack) 2 main.cpp void foo2(int), line 12
(stack) 3 main.cpp void foo1(), line 17
(stack) 4 main.cpp int main(int32_t, char **), line 22
```

NOTE: It should be thread safe as thread local storage is maintained for the callstack.
